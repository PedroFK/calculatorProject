# Calculator Project - 
Calculator design using an object-oriented programming ([OOP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_programming)) paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields, also known as attributes, and code, in the form of procedures, also known as methods.

## Chosen language
The chosen language was [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) because it is a simple language and is compatible with all major browsers.
